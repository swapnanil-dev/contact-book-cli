# Command-Line Contact Book

A complete, interactive command-line application built with Python that allows a user to manage a personal contact book. This was my first full application, built to master the fundamentals of Python, including user input, data structures, and permanent data storage with JSON.

## Features

* **Add New Contacts:** Users can add new contacts with a name, phone number, and email address.
* **View All Contacts:** Displays a clean, formatted list of all contacts currently stored in the system.
* **Search for a Contact:** Allows the user to find and display the details of a specific contact by searching for their name.
* **Persistent Storage:** The entire contact list is automatically saved to a `contacts.json` file when the program exits and is reloaded the next time it starts, ensuring no data is ever lost.
